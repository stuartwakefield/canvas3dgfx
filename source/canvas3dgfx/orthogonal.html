<h2>Orthogonal projection</h2>

<canvas id="canvas-1"></canvas>
<script src="../js/canvas-1.js"></script>

  This is one of the most basic projection techniques, it simply discards
  one of the axis information to create a two-dimensional representation
  of one of the faces, a fancy way of saying sides, of the object.

  In the following, very interesting, example of a cube, the z-axis
  information is discarded to show the front face of the object.
