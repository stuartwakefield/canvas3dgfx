  We then use the <strong>Vertex</strong> object to plot out the vertices of
  the model we are creating. As we are creating a cube we need 8 vertices, one
  for each corner of the cube. You might be asking: why -1.0 and 1.0 and why
  not any other number? This is a common convention within 3D graphics
  modelling, it gives us a normalized model that makes it easy to scale, rotate
  and translate later, being that the natural centre point (the origin) is 0.0.
